## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an engineer and HR consultant at Deloitte, I want a personalized AI-driven information curation system that automatically collects, analyzes, and summarizes relevant content from multiple sources, so that I can efficiently stay updated on technology trends, global HR trends, and business developments without spending excessive time manually browsing through irrelevant information.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the system has collected articles from configured sources, **When** I access my dashboard, **Then** I see a curated list of articles ranked by relevance to my interests and skill level
2. **Given** an article is available in the system, **When** I view it, **Then** I see both a brief summary for quick judgment and a detailed summary for comprehensive understanding
3. **Given** I have interacted with articles over time, **When** the system analyzes my behavior, **Then** it provides personalized recommendations that match my evolving interests and skill gaps
4. **Given** new content is available from multiple sources, **When** the automatic collection runs, **Then** the system categorizes content into technology, HR, and business topics with appropriate priority scoring
5. **Given** I provide feedback on article usefulness, **When** the system processes this feedback, **Then** future recommendations improve in accuracy and relevance

### Edge Cases
- What happens when external information sources are temporarily unavailable or change their structure?
- How does the system handle duplicate content from multiple sources?
- What occurs when AI summarization fails for certain content types?
- How does the system behave when a user's interests shift significantly over time?

## Requirements
