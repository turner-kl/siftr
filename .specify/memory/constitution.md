# Siftr Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Data-First
Every feature begins with defining data sources, collection mechanisms, and processing pipelines. Data integrity and completeness are non-negotiable. All information sources must be explicitly defined, validated, and monitored. External API dependencies require fallback strategies and error handling.

### II. AI-Driven Intelligence
Machine learning and AI capabilities are central to value delivery. All content must be automatically analyzed, categorized, and scored for relevance. Personalization algorithms must learn from user behavior to improve recommendation accuracy. AI processing costs must be monitored and optimized.

### III. User-Centric Design
User experience drives all interface decisions. Information presentation must prioritize clarity and efficiency over feature abundance. Every interaction should reduce cognitive load and decision time. Mobile-first responsive design is mandatory for accessibility.

### IV. Modularity
System architecture follows clear separation of concerns: collection, processing, analysis, and presentation. Each component must be independently testable and deployable. Database schemas support future extensibility without breaking changes. API contracts remain stable across iterations.

### V. Performance & Reliability
Sub-second response times for all user interactions. Information collection processes run asynchronously without blocking user workflows. System monitoring includes uptime, response times, AI processing costs, and user satisfaction metrics. Graceful degradation when external services are unavailable.

## Information Quality Standards

All collected content must meet minimum quality thresholds before user presentation. Duplicate detection and content deduplication are mandatory. Source credibility scoring influences content ranking. User feedback mechanisms continuously improve filtering accuracy. Multi-language content requires translation quality validation.

## Development Workflow

Test-driven development for all AI processing pipelines. Integration tests verify external API connectivity and data flow integrity. Code reviews must validate performance impact and cost implications. Database migrations require backwards compatibility verification. User acceptance testing validates recommendation accuracy and interface usability.

## Governance

Constitution compliance is verified at each development milestone. Technical debt requires explicit justification and remediation timelines. Performance regressions block releases until resolved. Use CLAUDE.md for Claude Code specific development guidance.
